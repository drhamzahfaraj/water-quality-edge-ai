# Ablation Study: Compression and Distillation
# Reproduces Table 2

experiment_name: "ablation_compression_distillation"

# Inherit most settings from main config
base_config: "config_main.yaml"

# Override specific settings for ablation
training:
  student:
    # Experiment 1: No distillation
    distillation_enabled: false
    loss:
      reconstruction_weight: 1.0
      distillation_weight: 0.0  # Turn off distillation
      compression_weight: 0.01
    
    # Experiment 2: With distillation
    # (uses default from main config)

evaluation:
  # Compare:
  # 1. Full-precision teacher (2.10M params)
  # 2. Compressed student without distillation (1.20M params)
  # 3. Compressed student with distillation (1.20M params)
